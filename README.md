# GenCameraDriver
## Introduction
Generic Industry Camera Driver, support capturing (software synchronization), JPEG compression, Saving to video

Now two kinds of cameras are supported

1. PointGrey 
2. XIMEA 

Examples are in main.cpp

## Dependency 
1. OpenCV 3.4.0 with CUDA 9.1
2. Intel MKL (Math Kernel Library), optional but recommended
3. CUDA 9.1
4. Visual Studio 2015 / GCC
5. CMake >= 3.10 (FindCUDA in low version can not work for CUDA 9.1 since NPP library has changed a lot in CUDA 9)
6. Spinnaker SDK for PointGrey cameras
7. XIMEA SDK for XIMEA cameras
